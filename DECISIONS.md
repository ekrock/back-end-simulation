# Decisions Log

Architectural and design decisions for the Back-End Assembly Line Simulator.

---

## Simulation

**Part Cycle Time definition** (2026-06-21)
Entry tick = when a robot is assigned to the cable at Station 1 (same tick the cable is removed from the Input Buffer). Exit tick = when the cable moves from the last assembly station into the Output Buffer. Includes all inter-station waiting time. This means Part CT can exceed the sum of operation times when cables block between stations.

**Robot assignment rule**
Cheapest robot whose ticks_per_action < target_ticks gets assigned. Fallback: cheapest eligible robot regardless of target. Arm routes to Route and Clip automatically in Cases 3–5 because it's the only type meeting the 20-tick target there.

**Cable assembly use case for sample scenarios**
Stations: Insert Cable into Port A / Route and Clip Cable / Insert Cable into Port B.
Times: Assembler 8/28/8, Arm 5/16/5, target_ticks=20.
Chosen because operation times create interesting bottleneck dynamics (see Cases_2-5_Analysis.md).

## Web / Flask

**Auth**
HTTP Basic Auth via Flask decorator. Two users: `eric` (admin/privileged) and `demo` (limited). Credentials in `.env` on EC2 (not committed).

**Run storage**
One directory per run under `data/runs/` (gitignored). Each run dir contains `meta.json`, `results.json`, `run_log.jsonl`, and the uploaded `config.csv`.

**Chart data endpoint**
`/api/chart-data` computes fleet cost at query time by joining robot_types × robot_counts from `meta.json`. Does not cache — re-reads all runs on each request.

## Docs

**HTML doc generator**
`scripts/maintenance/generate_doc_html.py` — ported from solar-agent. Run manually after editing any `docs/*.md`. Generates `docs/html/*.html` and `docs/html/index.html`. GROUPS list must be kept in sync with README's doc index.

**PRD sharing**
Shared via GitHub Markdown render (not GitHub Pages). URL: `https://github.com/ekrock/back-end-simulation/blob/main/docs/PRD.md`.

## Deployment

**Service name on EC2**: `back-end-simulation.service` (not `backendsim`)
**SSH alias**: `back-end-sim-ec2`
**No outer sudo** when running deploy scripts as the deploy user.
